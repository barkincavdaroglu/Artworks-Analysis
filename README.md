# Artworks-Analysis

Downloaded MET Museum's Open Access data for approximately 470.000 artworks, filtered it down to 2000 by excluding artworks that were not highlighted (and thus did not have descriptions on MET's webpage), scraped each of their descriptions from their webpages, generated topics from their descriptions using LDA, and added the topic with the max distribution to each object.
